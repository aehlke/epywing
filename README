This is a prototype Python library for reading EPWING-formatted dictionaries,
particularly for Japanese. It should be easy to use for most purposes.

epywing wraps ebmodule-2.2, which uses eb-4.4.3 (but should work with any 4.x release).
ebmodule-2.2 is an update to ebmodule 2.0 which I released to bring it up to date with 
eb and modern Python.
